# {{.Type}} ({{.Name}})

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

When using the `mapped_element_ids` argument of this resource, the resource will take over the management of the Routing Group's mapped elements.
This argument is incompatible with other methods of managing Routing Group's mapped elements, such as `routing_group_mapped_elements_attachment`.
Any attempt to manage Routing Group's mapped elements using different methods, will result in resource cycling and/or errors.

## Example Usage
