~> **NOTE:** The **pfptmeta_user_roles_attachment** resource creates **exclusive** role attachments.
Across the entire organization, all the roles attached to the user must be declared by a single pfptmeta_user_roles_attachment resource.
This means that any user with the roles attached using any other method, including other Terraform resources, will have its role attachments revoked.

## Example Usage
