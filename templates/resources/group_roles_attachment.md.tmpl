~> **NOTE:** The **pfptmeta_group_roles_attachment** resource creates **exclusive** role attachments.
Across the entire organization, all the roles attached to the group must be declared by a single pfptmeta_group_roles_attachment resource.
This means that any group with the roles attached using any other method, including other Terraform resources, will have its role attachments revoked.

## Example Usage
