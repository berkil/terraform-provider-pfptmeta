# pfptmeta_user (Resource)

Attaches roles to group.

!> **WARNING:** The **pfptmeta_group_roles_attachment** resource creates **exclusive** attachments of roles.
Across the entire organization, all the roles attached to the group must be declared by a single pfptmeta_group_roles_attachment resource.
This means that even any group that have the attached roles via any other mechanism (including other Terraform resources) will have that attached role revoked by this resource.
