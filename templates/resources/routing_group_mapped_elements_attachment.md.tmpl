# {{.Type}} ({{.Name}})

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

~> **NOTE:** Having multiple **routing_group_mapped_elements_attachment** resources in conjunction with the same routing group and mapped elements will result in erratic behavior!

~> **NOTE:** For any given routing group, this resource is incompatible with the `pfptmeta_routing_group`
[resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/nsofnetworks/pfptmeta/latest/docs/resources/routing_group) `mapped_elements_ids` argument.
When using this argument and resource simulteneously, both of them will attempt to manage the routing group's mapped elements. As a result, Terraform will display a permanent difference.

## Example Usage
