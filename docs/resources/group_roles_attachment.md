# pfptmeta_user (Resource)

Attaches roles to group.

!> **WARNING:** The **pfptmeta_group_roles_attachment** resource creates **exclusive** attachments of roles.
Across the entire organization, all the roles attached to the group must be declared by a single pfptmeta_group_roles_attachment resource.
This means that even any group that have the attached roles via any other mechanism (including other Terraform resources) will have that attached role revoked by this resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pfptmeta_group" "group" {
  name = "admins"
}

resource "pfptmeta_role" "metaport_role" {
  name       = "metaport role"
  privileges = ["metaports:read", "metaports:write"]
}

resource "pfptmeta_role" "network_element_role" {
  name       = "network element role"
  privileges = ["network_elements:read", "network_elements:write"]
}

resource "pfptmeta_group_roles_attachment" "attachment" {
  group_id = pfptmeta_group.group.id
  roles    = [pfptmeta_role.metaport_role.id, pfptmeta_role.network_element_role.id]
}
```
